# Third-party notices

## blader/humanizer (MIT)

The 26 AI-writing patterns in `skills/write-script/references/ai-patterns.md` are summarized and adapted for
spoken scripts from [blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer), which in turn draws on Wikipedia's
"Signs of AI writing" guidance. No code from that project is included.

## morph-clips

`skills/morph-clips` adapts the engine design and render approach of
[Barty-Bart/motion-graphics](https://github.com/Barty-Bart/motion-graphics) (MIT), uses icon paths adapted from
Lucide (ISC, some icons derived from Feather under MIT) and bundles the Inter and JetBrains Mono fonts (SIL Open
Font License 1.1, license texts in `skills/morph-clips/fonts/`). The full notices follow.

### Barty-Bart/motion-graphics (MIT)

The engine design (closed-form springs summed per target change, content swap with
blur, cursor-driven scene runner) and the render approach (sub-frame capture blended
into motion blur, composite and review pages) are adapted from
[Barty-Bart/motion-graphics](https://github.com/Barty-Bart/motion-graphics),
`skills/motion-broll`. morph-clips rewrites them with its own API, a brand system,
layout placements with protected boxes, an overflow check, and a single cross-platform
Node CLI.
